 What's this?0
 This program was developed by me to aid modders in creating and editting EA's  The Battle for Middle Earth's 1 and 2none0  special effects
This version only supports the 'FXParticleSystem' type and not the 'ParticleSystem' type as of this version

 Im having problems Running IT!!!
 If you are having problems just starting this up it could be up to 3 things
- Framework
 -The required framework for windows is '.Net Framework v2.0' or better
 -To download the newest Framework heres a link
 @ http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en
- Managed Directx
 -The required Directx version is 9.0c, however you need Managed Directx to run it.
 -To Download Managed Directx heres a link
 @ http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c72d9f1e-53f3-4747-8490-6801d8e8b4ef&DisplayLang=en
 -Graphics Card
 -You have to have a decent graphics card to run at a good FPS

 I get Errors while running the program!!!
 If you get errors while running it all errors are deposited into "Errors.xml" in the 'Config' Folder at the executables location (you can view the error in notepad)
If you cant solve the problem yourself please feel free to email me and remember to send along the xml file.

 To Do's:
 - Particle Color
 -In this version the Coloring of the particle is off, it is being worked on, I promise
 -Particle Alpha
-In this version the Alpha (transparency) of the particle is also off, it is also being worked on.
 -Particle System Rotation
 -When you rotate the bone in the center of the Particle System the System will adapt to the rotations and display it at its proper angles
 -Its used for when your attaching a Particle System to a bone, bones have a rotation and change the positions and direction of a particle
 -Editting & Viewing Multiple Particle Systems
 -Ill be adding the functionalites of this in the next version
 -Wind
 -Setup wind system
 -Fix all "Not Supported in this Verson"
 -Where it says that below, it should be out on the next version\f0\fs28
  Other:
 -All Errors are Written in "Config\\Errors.xml"
-The Beginning Particle system is "Config\ticleSystem.xml"
-Settings to change font, color, and floor is in "Config\\Configuration.xml"

 Priority   =( ALWAYS_RENDER, CRITICAL, AREA_EFFECT, WEAPON_TRAIL, CONSTANT, SEMI_CONSTANT, 
   DEATH_EXPLOSION, UNIT_DAMAGE_FX, DEBRIS_TRAIL, BUILDUP, DUST_TRAIL, SCORCH_MARK, WEAPON_EXPLOSION)
 -This is the priority for rendering the particle system in bfme, the most critical 'ALWAYS_RENDER' will however 
   make it be rendered always
   
 Shader  = (ALPHA, ADDITIVE)
 -This is to tell the System how to display the particles, play with it to get different effects.
 
 SystemLifetime  = (Value)

 ParticleName  = (TextureName.tga)
 -This is the name of the texture located in Textures.Big
 
 IsOneShot  = (Yes or No)
 -If Yes, this System will die in 'SystemLifetime' amount of milliseconds, however if you wish it to render the whole 
   time you dont need to put this at all
   
 IsGroundAligned  = (Yes or No)
 -If Yes, the particles will align with the ground so their horizontal, however if you wish it not to be ground aligned, 
   and always face the camera then you dont need to put this at all\f1

   current one
   
 -Values range from (0-255), Time (last value) is in milliseconds
 ColorScale  = (Value Value)
 - Not supported in this versionnone , function Unknown
 
 ; -- Alpha Breakdown
 Alpha:
 Definition none = Transpareny of the Particle
 
 Alpha # = (Value Value Value)
 -This is the alpha (transparency) of the particle at the certain time
 -As the particle progresses in life, it sets the alpha to a random value between the first 2 Values, and then sets the 
   destination alpha to the alpha after the current one
 -Values range from (0-invisible, 1-visible), Time (last Value) is in milliseconds
 
 ; -- Update Breakdown
 Update:
 Definition none = Values that effect attributes about the particle, happens every frame and continues along its life
 
 SizeRate  = (Value Value)
 -This is how the size progress in life, if negative the particle will shrink, if positive it will grow.
 
 SizeRateDamping  = (Value Value)
 -This is the damping, (acceleration) in which the sizerate increases. If 1, it will maintain a normal rate, If 1.01 or higher it will 
   increase acceleration rate, if .99 or lower it will decrease acceleration rate.
   
 AngleZ  = (Value Value)
 -This is the Initial angle of the Particle (0-360), \f1 , random between both values\f2
 
 AngularRateZ  = (Value Value)
 -This is the rate at which the angle of the particle changes, if negative it will move right, if positive it will move left, 
   random between both values
   
 AngularDamping  = (Value Value)

FXParticleSystem in a Nutshell
0 The Particle System is triggered...
It waits 'InitialDelay' amount of seconds...
'BurstCount' amount of particles are released every 'BurstDelay' amount of time...
particles are set to 'Size' and size increases 'SizeRate', 'SizeRate is multiplied by 'SizeDamping'.....
particle rotation is set to 'AngleZ' and it increases 'AngularRateZ', 'AngularRateZ' is multiplied by 'AngularDamping'....
particles position is determined by 'EmissionVolume'....
particles velocity is determined by 'EmissionVelocity', that is multiplied by 'VelocityDamping'...
particles positon adds 'DriftVelocity' to its position, and Adds 'Gravity' to its ZLocation
If 'IsOneShot' and 'SystemLifetime' is up then System Dies, particles stop being produced and existing die.
